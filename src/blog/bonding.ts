# The Brain's Bonding Strategy

Have you ever wondered why we sometimes accept what someone we love says without question?
Why do we try to explain their behavior not with logic, but with emotion?

*When we love someone, it’s not just our feelings that change — the way our brain works changes too.*

In a 2004 fMRI study conducted by Bartels and Zeki, mothers looking at photos of their own babies showed **suppressed activity in the amygdala**, the brain region responsible for threat detection.
The same pattern was observed in individuals experiencing romantic love.

When focusing on a loved one, the brain shows decreased activity in the **amygdala** and in **prefrontal regions** responsible for critical evaluation.
This reduction can lead to bonding without noticing potential risks.

## The Mind Pushes Criticism Aside

Love doesn’t only suppress the perception of threat; it also affects higher-order cognitive processes such as **social judgment**, **theory of mind**, and **self-awareness**.
The brain region responsible for these functions — the **Default Mode Network (DMN)** — becomes less active when focusing on a loved one.
This shift redirects attention outward — toward the loved one — and allows bonding to occur without active questioning.

Alongside this, the brain’s **reward system** becomes active. Neurochemicals like **dopamine**, **oxytocin**, and **vasopressin** are released:

- **Dopamine** increases the feeling of pleasure and motivation.
- **Oxytocin** supports trust and bonding.
- **Vasopressin** strengthens the drive to protect and possess.

That’s why we sometimes can’t see the flaws of someone we love.
Even when they’re right in front of us, we ignore them.
Because in that moment, our brain may suppress rational evaluation processes; it stops scanning for threats, reduces cognitive load, and focuses entirely on bonding and maintaining the connection.

All of this shows that love is a **neurobiological state that directly shapes our perception**.
The brain preferentially processes information that does not conflict with the emotional bond, leading to **selective perception** in relationships.

*"He’s just like that when he’s angry — he’s actually a good person."*
*"He’s going through a rough time. That’s not who he really is."*

### But what if that person ends up disappointing us?

Then the brain is shaken.

The **amygdala** goes back into high alert, the **DMN** reactivates, and the mind begins to analyze constantly:
*"How did I not see this?"*

This creates a type of **neurobiological trauma**.
The brain struggles to process that a source it had marked as “safe” for so long has now become a threat.

All the decisions made about that person now seem “wrong.”
This leads to **a questioning of self-perception, intuition, and choices.**
With the collapse of trust, internal questioning begins:

*"Why did I allow them to treat me that way?"*
*"I sensed something was off… but how did I miss the signs right in front of me?"*

## Healing Begins with Awareness

In the first stage, the brain **denies** the situation.
Then, it tries to **make sense** of the experience by piecing together the fragments and creating a new internal framework.

Eventually, the brain learns to bond again — but now it’s **more selective**, **more cautious**, and **stronger than before.**
Because this time, it has been shaped by experience.
