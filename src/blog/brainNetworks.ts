# Brain Networks: Understanding the Mechanics

The mind is never truly at rest. A suddenly emerging memory, an inexplicable worry, or a fleeting daydream... These thoughts sometimes appear meaningful, sometimes scattered, and often arise without any deliberate effort. But what is this background state of the mind?

**In my previous article**, I conceptually discussed two systems working together in our minds—especially the automatic and intuitive nature of *System 1* and the slow and reflective structure of *System 2*. In this article, I will focus on the biological side of the mental process, without delving too deeply into technical terms.

Just like System 1, which operates beyond our conscious control, neuroscience defines the brain’s underlying neural infrastructure as the *Default Mode Network* (DMN). This network becomes active when the mind turns inward—while daydreaming, reflecting on the past, or planning for the future. Through this network, the mind forms the foundation of our mental existence: it shapes **who we are, what we feel, and what we will do**. Even when we prepare what to say in an argument or mentally simulate scenarios before making a decision, this network is at work.

The Default Mode Network was first discovered in the late 1990s, when researchers observed a consistent “decrease in activity” in certain brain regions during tasks that required focused attention.

In 1997, Shulman and his team noticed that blood flow decreased in some brain areas when people directed their attention to the external world. When they investigated the cause of this, a new idea emerged: perhaps these regions were actually active while the person was at rest.

In 2001, Raichle introduced the term “default mode” to describe this “task-free yet active” state. This marked the scientific definition of the *Default Mode Network*, which showed that the mind continues to operate internally even in the absence of external stimuli.

The regions shown in the image belong to the cortical (surface) areas of the Default Mode Network. The visualization is taken from Menon’s 2023 review study (*Menon, V. (2023)*).

### What Processes Does the Default Mode Network Manage?

Neuroscientist *Vinod Menon’s* (2011) research has shown that the Default Mode Network plays an active role particularly in the following mental processes:

-**Self-Referential Thinking:**
  Inward-looking questions like “Why did I feel that way?” or “What kind of person am I?” arise during this process. Self-directed emotions such as shame, pride, or regret are also formed here.

-**Social Cognition:**
  This is the effort to understand what others are feeling or thinking. It involves putting oneself in someone else’s shoes, sensing their intentions, and predicting their behavior.

-**Memory and Imagination (Episodic/Autobiographical Memory):**
  We relive past experiences and recall how we felt at specific times and places. Based on these memories, we imagine what might happen in the future. It forms a bridge between past and future.

-**Language and Semantic Memory:**
  We recall the meanings of words. We connect concepts and organize information into mental structures. This system is active while speaking or reading.

-**Mind-Wandering:**
  The mind can drift aimlessly from one thought to another; it daydreams, recalls the past, or constructs fictional scenarios. This free-flowing state can enhance creativity, facilitate problem-solving, and aid in future planning.

According to Menon, the self consists of two layers: the **individual self**, which allows us to be aware of our own emotions and behaviors, and the **social self**, which helps us understand what others might be thinking. Through this structure, we shape how we perceive both ourselves and the world.

> *So, when does this internal stream come to an end?*

When the mind shifts to a task that requires attention, the DMN is deactivated. In its place, another brain network takes over: the **Central Executive Network (CEN)**.

However, this switch doesn't happen automatically; it is governed by a regulatory mechanism—the brain’s selective control system. At this point, the **Salience Network** comes into play.

Its role is to assign a **“priority ranking”** among various stimuli from the environment or internal states and decide which information requires attention. But if an unexpected or novel signal appears right after an important stimulus is detected, then the **Ventral Attention Network (VAN)**—the brain’s radar—activates, automatically redirecting attention to the new target.

The **Salience Network** typically becomes **active** in the following situations:

- When a **sudden and attention-grabbing stimulus** appears in the external environment (e.g., a loud sound or bright light)
- In response to **physiological signals** from the body (e.g., hunger, pain, changes in heart rate)
- During moments of **intense emotional arousal** (e.g., anger, excitement, anxiety)
- When encountering **new or unexpected information**
- When initiating communication with someone or during a **social interaction**
- When detecting a potential **threat or risk** in the environment

### **Central Executive Network (CEN)**

Its role is to maintain cognitive control and focus on the external world during attention-demanding situations. The CEN is activated during active thinking, decision-making, and problem-solving. It also plays a significant role in sequential tasks (**multitasking**), such as taking notes during a meeting or following conversations while giving a presentation.

However, the brain does **not** perform these tasks **simultaneously**; instead, it manages them by switching **very rapidly** between them. During these transitions, it works in conjunction with the **Dorsal Attention Network (DAN)**. As task complexity increases, these transitions become harder and performance declines. *(Madore & Wagner, 2019)*

> ***So, where exactly in the brain are decisions made?***

Decision-making is a process involving multiple brain regions. However, at the center of this process lies the **prefrontal cortex**, the brain’s frontal region.

According to a study by Asgher et al. (2018), the functions of the prefrontal cortex in decision-making can be broken down as follows:

- **Dorsolateral region**: Helps focus attention and supports planning.
- **Ventrolateral region**: Evaluates social situations and verbal input.
- **Orbitofrontal region**: Weighs emotions, reward-punishment relationships, and possible outcomes.
- **Medial region**: Considers the self and what others might be thinking.

In other words, decision-making doesn't rely on a single brain network, but rather on the collaboration of these regions. The prefrontal cortex integrates all this information to shape the final decision.

__If the balance between networks is disrupted, the mind struggles to shift between the inner and outer world; errors occur in prioritization; attention scatters, and thoughts spiral out of control.__

For the mind to function properly, brain networks must work in harmony. Any imbalance in the system disrupts the transitions between networks—some become overly active, while others fail to engage adequately. This disconnection underlies many psychiatric disorders.

To better understand this, let’s look at a comprehensive meta-analysis conducted in 2020 by **Doucet and colleagues**. The researchers reviewed 70 different resting-state fMRI studies examining how the DMN changes across various psychiatric disorders—particularly those affecting mood, anxiety, and thought processes. In total, 2,789 patients were compared with 3,002 healthy individuals. The findings revealed that in many disorders, **connectivity within the DMN—especially in the anterior and posterior internal brain regions—was significantly weakened**.

> _We’ve seen how the DMN operates in the adult mind, but how did it all begin?_

Now, let’s explore how the sense of self emerges from birth onward, and how the DMN accompanies this development.

In a 2009 study by Gao and colleagues, 71 healthy infants (ranging from 2 weeks to 2 years old) and 15 adults were examined using resting-state fMRI. The aim was to understand when the DMN first appears and how it develops.

The results showed that **the default network exists in a primitive and incomplete form immediately after birth**. The researchers found that around the age of 1, the network becomes more complex, and its connections strengthen—by age 2, it nearly reaches the structure seen in adult brains.

One of the study’s most striking findings was the consistent observation of the **posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)**—a region responsible for functions like memory recall, introspection, and attention direction—from birth onward. This is why it is considered the **central hub** of the DMN.

The **medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)**, which begins to activate around age 1 and gradually takes on greater functional importance, forms the foundation of more complex mental processes such as self-awareness, understanding others' minds, empathy, and social cognition.

> _So, under what conditions does the mind generate thoughts on its own?_

Thoughts that spontaneously arise in the mind are often triggered by the following conditions:

- **Unprocessed emotions**: Incomplete emotional experiences such as suppressed anger, sadness, or guilt
- **States of uncertainty**: Situations lacking clarity about the future or moments of indecision
- **Unresolved conflicts**: Inner contradictions or unfinished events from the past
- **Threats to self-image**: Situations that risk damaging the self, like criticism, failure, or rejection
- **Emotional triggers**: Stimuli associated with the past, such as a familiar voice, smell, place, face, or piece of music
- **Echoes after social interaction**: Following an intense, striking, or unsettling conversation, the mind replays the moment, obsessively revisiting what was said
- **Reactivation of memories**: Whether deliberately recalled or spontaneously resurfacing due to a random cue, the mind returns to past events
- **Breaking the routine**: Situations open to free association, like walking or traveling, when attention is scattered
- **Moments of waking or falling asleep**: During shifts in consciousness, repressed mental content can surface
- **Emergence during mind-wandering**: The mind may project past experiences into the future and begin planning spontaneously. When focusing on a new topic, previously unnoticed information may emerge. These unconsciously processed contents can eventually merge into conscious thought and lead to creative insights at unexpected times
- **Fatigue or mental relaxation**: When the mind moves away from intense focus, attention becomes unbound. Thoughts begin to flow without control. That sudden idea during a walk, while lying down, or staring into space is a result of this. As the outer world fades, the inner world becomes active.

**Ultimately**, the spontaneous thoughts that arise in the mind are **outputs of the internal models shaped by each individual's unique way of perceiving the world.**
